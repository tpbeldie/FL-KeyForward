# FL-KeyForward
Bridge that receives global keyboard inputs and forwards them to FL Studio, bypassing third party plugin focusing lock off typing keyboard, allowing for a continuous singing via typing keyboard while interacting with the plugin.

Clicking "Allow the plugin to handle keystrokes before the host does", Toggling "Keep focus" and other annoying settings that probably won't fix the issue are not required anymore. No plugin will ever steal focus from you anymore... how dare it?

Pretty much how it goes:
